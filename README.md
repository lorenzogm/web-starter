# AI Toolbox

This repository provides concise, ready-to-use developer tooling for AI-assisted workflows. It includes:

- GitHub Copilot chat modes and usage instructions
- Reusable prompt templates for common tasks (tickets, UI guidance, etc.)
- VS Code settings and recommended extensions, including Model Context Protocol (MCP) server configurations

See `.github/chatmodes/` for Copilot modes, `.github/prompts/` for prompt templates, and `.vscode/mcp.json` for MCP server inputs and configuration.

Keep your MCP inputs (e.g., `ATLASSIAN_API_KEY`, `ATLASSIAN_URL`, `FIGMA_API_KEY`, `CONTENTFUL_API_KEY`, `EMAIL`) configured in your VS Code settings or environment when using MCP servers.

For full development and contribution guidelines, consult the individual files in `.github/` and `.vscode/`.
